# ESP8266 Heart Rate Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a heart rate sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor heart rate data. The sensor detects heartbeats and transmits analog signals to the ESP8266, which processes and displays the heart rate information.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Heart Rate Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connections:**
   - **Analog Output (Signal) Pin:** Connect this pin from the heart rate sensor to an analog pin on the ESP8266 (e.g., A0).
   - **VCC:** Connect the VCC pin of the heart rate sensor to a 3.3V or 5V pin on the ESP8266, based on sensor specifications.
   - **GND:** Connect the GND pin of the heart rate sensor to a GND pin on the ESP8266 for common ground.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the analog readings from the heart rate sensor.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, ensure the heart rate sensor is properly placed and connected.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor to see the analog values representing the heart rate sensor output.

#### Applications
- **Health Monitoring:** Suitable for continuous monitoring of heart rate in medical devices and wearable technology.
- **Fitness Tracking:** Integrates well into fitness trackers and smartwatches for real-time heart rate monitoring during workouts.
- **Biometric Systems:** Can be used in biometric authentication systems based on unique heart rate patterns.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Placement:** Properly position the heart rate sensor on the body for accurate readings.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure stable power supply to the ESP8266 and heart rate sensor for consistent operation.
- **Calibration:** Calibrate the sensor if necessary to ensure accurate measurement and alignment with expected heart rate ranges.
